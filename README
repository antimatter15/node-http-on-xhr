What is this? This is a implementation of a node-js 
(which I think is based on commonJS's thing, just 
skimmed the spec so I have no idea if it's the same)
-like http module that runs in the browser (or a chrome
extension) based on XMLHttpRequest.

It isn't a CommonJS module because I have no need for
any commonJS magic. 

I probably should have done more extensive googling before
actually starting this project since no doubt another similar
and less hacky one exists.
